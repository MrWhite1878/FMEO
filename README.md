## The Game
1. Hopefully everyone knows how to play tic-tac-toe... otherwise https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe
2. For super tic-tac-toe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe
## Files
1. AI_X.py is a early-model AI for X on the super tic-tac-toe game
2. Main.py is a simple GUI super tic-tac-toe where two humans play against each other
3. MainAI.py is the same but against the AI
4. TicTacToe contains a simple console TicTacToe and a perfect AI for both X and O
## Goal
The goal is an AI that can constistently beat humans in super tic-tac-toe. Obviously we have a long ways to go, but the tic-tac-toe AI was a good proof of concept.
## For Readers
This is a large project (at least to me) with a long way to go, so I appreciate any help. If you'd like to run the programs, feel free to download and share (Game.py, Main.py, and MainAI.py are going to be the game ones). If you find any bugs or have any feedback, you can dm me @mikal6559 on discord. If you would like to contribute to development, reach out and I'll give you perms to the repo. Also, I tried really hard to comment well, but if you have any questions, again, just reach out. Enjoy!!
### Thank you to readers and Jaan for playing super tic-tac-toe with me in the first place
